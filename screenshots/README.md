### Option 1: Using VS Code Simple Browser (Currently Open)
1. The Simple Browser is now showing your dashboard
2. Right-click on the preview and select "Capture Screenshot" (if available)
3. Or use your OS screenshot tool while the Simple Browser is visible

### Option 2: Manual Screenshot
1. Open http://127.0.0.1:8081 in your regular web browser
2. Fill in some sample values (e.g., Voltage: 480V, Current: 100A, 3-Phase)
3. Take a screenshot showing the complete interface with results
4. Save it as `dashboard-preview.png` in this folder

### Option 3: Using a Browser Extension
1. Open the dashboard in Chrome/Firefox
2. Use an extension like "Full Page Screenshot" or "Awesome Screenshot"
3. Capture the full page including the input section and results
4. Save as `dashboard-preview.png`

### Recommended Screenshot Content
